# YD-LiDAR-Based-Obstacle-Detection-Direction-Control-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Welcome to the repository of our custom-developed YD-LiDAR based algorithm for autonomous driving systems. This system integrates obstacle detection and directional decision-making using the YD-LiDAR X2/X2L sensor, making it suitable for embedded vehicle control in autonomous navigation tasks.
